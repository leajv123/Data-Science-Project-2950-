    "### The History of Stop-and-Frisk in NYC:\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program is a crime-prevention strategy in which officers temporarily detain, question, and often search individuals suspected of carrying weapons or contraband. The program gained traction in the early 2000s under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and reached its height in 2011, a year in which an estimated 685,724 civilians were stopped by the NYPD. In August of 2013, US District Court Judge Sheila Scheindlin ruled in Floyd v. City of New York that stop-and-frisk had been implemented by the NYPD in an unconstitutional manner. This decision marked a turning point in the program through the subsequent NYPD mandate that all officers thoroughly justify and document the reason for each stop. Instances of stop-and-frisk declined in the following years due to accusations of racial profiling, as many believed the program disproportionately targeted African-American and Latino individuals. While the percentage of NYPD resources that was devoted to the stop-and-frisk program is not publicly available, the funding and manpower that must have been required to make hundreds of thousands of stops for over a decade begs the question: was the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program truly effective at reducing crime in New York? Or, was it simply an act of racial discrimination designed to incite fear in the streets? "
