    "### The History of Stop-and-Frisk in NYC:\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program is a crime-prevention strategy in which officers temporarily detain, question, and often search individuals suspected of carrying weapons or contraband. The program gained traction in the early 2000s under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and reached its height in 2011, a year in which an estimated 685,724 civilians were stopped by the NYPD. In August of 2013, US District Court Judge Sheila Scheindlin ruled in Floyd v. City of New York that stop-and-frisk had been implemented by the NYPD in an unconstitutional manner. This decision marked a turning point in the program through the subsequent NYPD mandate that all officers thoroughly justify and document the reason for each stop. Instances of stop-and-frisk declined in the following years due to accusations of racial profiling, as many believed the program disproportionately targeted African-American and Latino individuals. While the percentage of NYPD resources that was devoted to the stop-and-frisk program is not publicly available, the funding and manpower that must have been required to make hundreds of thousands of stops for over a decade begs the question: was the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program truly effective at reducing crime in New York? Or, was it simply an act of racial discrimination designed to incite fear in the streets? "

    "**Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created to document every police-civilian encounter that falls under the NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk program. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) created the dataset for their records; it is also available for public use. The dataset was funded by the government via taxpayer dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance (row) of this dataset is a recorded stop of a civilian during 2011. After removing irrelevant columns of data, the dimensions of this dataset was 685,724 x 23. 2011 was the height of the Stop, Question, and Frisk program, which provides an explanation as to why this dataset is so large. We then took a random sample of 10% of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column represents a different datum regarding the stop recorded for that row. We kept a total of 23 data points regarding a single stop. Those 23 points were about a suspect’s race, age, sex, if an arrest was made, how long they were observed for, how long they were stopped for, the borough the stop was made in, whether a weapon was found on them, if the officer used physical force, and whether a summons was issued to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains all possible instances of people who were stopped during the Stop, Question, and Frisk program. There is the chance that some stops were not recorded in this dataset for reasons outside of our control (ex: an officer did not report it), but if the dataset stays true to its original purpose, it should contain every instance of a stop during the Stop, Question, and Frisk program in 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance (row) of this dataset is a recorded stop of a civilian during 2011. Each instance consists of information on the suspect’s race, age, sex, if an arrest was made, how long they were observed for, how long they were stopped for, the borough the stop was made in, whether a weapon was found on them, if the officer used physical force, and whether a summons was issued to them.\n",

    "There are null inputs for some columns but we can generally assume that null means none or no. For example, if no arrest was made, the input for an arrest offense may be null and in this case, null means there is no arrest offense. We are limited in our understanding of what these null inputs mean, as the data specifications released by the NYPD do not address the null entries. Given what we know, it is our most educated guess that the null inputs mean none or no. Relationships between individual instances are not made explicit. One column does record if another person(s) present at the scene of the encounter were also searched, but does not indicate the specific person(s), if any.\n",

    "This dataset was created in order to aggregate the annual crime data in New York City, including felony, misdemeanor, and violation offenses from 2009 to 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was composed from four individual datasets created by the New York Police Department (NYPD) for the public. The four original datasets consisted of data regarding the Seven Major Felony Offenses, Non Major Felony Offenses, Misdemeanor Offenses, and Violation Offenses. \n",

    "The instances that comprise the dataset represent the aggregate counts of each type of criminal offense within the categories of Major Felonies, Nonmajor Felonies, Misdemeanors, and Violations reported in NYC by the NYPD by year (2009-2019). There are 374 instances in total in the dataset, indexed by type of offense and year of occurrence. Under each year, there are entries consistent with 34 types of offenses, each of which are considered either a Major Felony, Nonmajor Felony, Misdemeanor, or Violation Offense under New York state and/or Federal Law. For each type of offense, there are 11 entries, one for each year from 2009 to 2019. The dataset is not a sample and contains all possible instances. However, the four datasets from which this one was composed were likely created by aggregating data on each individual criminal offense reported by the NYPD in the relevant time period. Each instance in the dataset consists of an aggregated count for each type of criminal offense reported by the NYPD by year (2009-2019). Each instance is labeled by type of criminal offense, category of offense (Major Felony, Nonmajor Felony, Misdemeanor, or Violation) and year. No information is missing from individual instances. Each instance of data includes the necessary information and context. However, each instance is merely the count per type of criminal offense per year, not the individual instances of crime themselves. The relationship between individual instances is made explicit. The count of each type of criminal offense can be compared across years (2000-2020). Likewise, the count of each type of criminal offense can be compared within each year.\n",

The dataset does not contain data that would likely be perceived as offensive, insulting, threatening, or anxiety-inducing if viewed directly.

    "The data associated with each instance is not directly observable, as it was acquired by aggregating data collected from external datasets. The four dataset used to compose this one were produced by the NYPD from their own reporting, so the data was likely validated internally. The data was collected by aggregating individual instances of criminal offenses collected by manual human curation via NYPD reports. The police officers who collected this data did so as part of the crime-reporting operations and public disclosure. These officials of the NYPD were likely compensated in their capacity as a state employee. The data was collected over the course of roughly a decade, 2009-2019.\n",
    "\n",

    "The four datasets used to create the final dataset were likely pre-processed by the NYPD to produce such clean data. Even still, in the process of combining the four datasets, each one had to first be cleaned to eliminate data from years that do not pertain to the timeline of interest within the guiding research question. The four datasets also had to be cleaned to be properly formatted, which included renaming the columns, removing missing values, renaming the offense types, and casting all numbers as ints. Finally, a column was added to indicate the category of offense (Major Felony, Nonmajor Felony, Misdemeanor, or Violation) for reference in the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data was saved both in the original file formats and as DataFrames (major_felony_raw, nonmajor_felony_raw, misdemeanor_raw, and violation_raw). The dataset was cleaned using Python within a Jupyter Lab Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uses**\n",

    "This dataset has not been used for any tasks already. However, the four datasets from which it was composed may have been used for other purposes, though the website in which these datasets were found (ny.gov) does not provide any information regarding any prior use. The dataset could possibly be used for other analyses that pertain to the changes in felony crimes rates in NYC over the last decade. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the provider of the four datasets used to create this one (the NYPD) does not specifically detail their process of collecting and preprocessing the data, so we cannot infer how future users may be impacted by their decisions. In the process of cleaning the final dataset, certain offense types were renamed for ease and consistency. While minimal context was lost, future users would benefit from examining the four datasets from which the final was composed in order to see the offense types as listed by the NYPD."

    "The two groups of data we have are datasets of the NYPD's Stop and Frisk instances for 2011 and 2019, and general crime data including major and minor felonies, misdemeanors, and violations in NYC for the years 2009-2019. Our stop and frisk data is only for NYC so we cannot use it as a representation of stop and frisks in other locations. Since the Stop and Frisk data is collected by the police officers who make the stops, the data is dependent on police officers’ judgement and possible bias. Officers make stops when they observe others and have suspicion to frisk them or probable cause to search them. The data is therefore limited in part to the individual officer’s judgment. For example, one officer may find a pedestrian suspicious and frisk them while another officer may not make that same judgement. In this way, there may be gaps or inconsistencies in our data in what one considers to be suspicious activity because it varies among officers and the accepted conditions of suspicious activities may also change throughout the years. The stop data is also limited by whether or not the officer decides to report it. There may be more stops made than we actually have in the data and we will not be able to analyze those unrecorded stops. Another limitation of this data is the missing data in many of the instances of the datasets. During our data cleaning section, we had to drop many instances where the age, observation duration, or boro information was poorly recorded or empty entirely. Those dropped instances do not have a chance to be considered in our analysis. While we cannot come up with a definitive answer to whether or not those dropped instances will make a significant difference to our analysis, we still must recognize their lost potential to affect our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case for general crime data is slightly different when it comes to underreporting. Underreporting in a stop and frisk case is dependent on the officer while for general crime statistics, regular civilians may be involved in crime and choose not to report it. Reasons for the public underreporting crime can be due to a distrust in the police, whether one is an undocumented immigrant, or a prior settlement. According to an article written by the West Virginia University,  up to or above 90% or rape cases go unreported. The most common reason for not reporting rape are fear of not being believed, insecurity, and fear of getting into trouble.(1) We can conclude our data does not include all crime occurrences since it is dependent on civilians reporting or police officers reporting crime.\n",

In order to condense the physical force data, we made a general physical force column that records whether or not any physical force was used during the encounter, but will be keeping a separate column specifying if a weapon was drawn and / or pointed during the encounter.

In the age column, it seems that if an officer did not know the age of the suspect, the age was coded as a number far above what is humanly possible - anywhere from ~145 to 999. Part of this error could also be due to typos. For example, when entering the police report into the dataset, an officer could have added an extra 0 to '15' to make it '150'. We made the executive decision to drop any rows that had an age listed above 110, because it is not realistic to analyze this when we do not know the real age of the suspect. In addition, we will be using age data a lot in out analysis, so these errors would disrupt later analysis.\n",

However, it is likely that 999 is code for unknown because there are a handful of 999 values in these columns, and it is the max value present in both columns. If we were to keep these 999 values, they would definitely cause issues with analysis later because they are extreme outliers in the datasets.
